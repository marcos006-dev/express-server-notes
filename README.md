> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable >content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that >it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content >here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing >packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a >search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various >versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose >(injected humour and the like).
